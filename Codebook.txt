## Codebook for run_analysis.R script

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables:

dataDir - Directory to store downloaded data file
zipFilePath - downloaded file name
dataSetDir - directory to store unziped files from the downloaded data file

data - a data frame of the dataset combined train and test datasets
label - read from features.txt dataset
activity - data frame with 6 activities, 30 activity ids
subject - data frame readed from subject_train.txt. 30 ids

Find_Mean_Std function - Extracting those colnames which contains "std()" and "mean()" from the data file

mean_std_data - data frame with all observations which have available variables (mean or standard deviations 
tidy - data frame with dimension 180x81 with all calculated means and standard deviations

tidy.txt - New output file with final cleaned data
